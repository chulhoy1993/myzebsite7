> Let's try to figure out how IBM practices different pay practice according to employees' roles!   

```{r hr_dataset}

hr_dataset <- read_csv(here::here("data", "datasets_1067_1925_WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv"))
glimpse(hr_dataset)

```

I am going to clean the data set, as variable names are in capital letters, some variables are not really necessary, and some variables, e.g., `education` are given as a number rather than a more useful description


```{r hr_cleaned}

hr_cleaned <- hr_dataset %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    education = case_when(
      education == 1 ~ "Below College",
      education == 2 ~ "College",
      education == 3 ~ "Bachelor",
      education == 4 ~ "Master",
      education == 5 ~ "Doctor"
    ),
    environment_satisfaction = case_when(
      environment_satisfaction == 1 ~ "Low",
      environment_satisfaction == 2 ~ "Medium",
      environment_satisfaction == 3 ~ "High",
      environment_satisfaction == 4 ~ "Very High"
    ),
    job_satisfaction = case_when(
      job_satisfaction == 1 ~ "Low",
      job_satisfaction == 2 ~ "Medium",
      job_satisfaction == 3 ~ "High",
      job_satisfaction == 4 ~ "Very High"
    ),
    performance_rating = case_when(
      performance_rating == 1 ~ "Low",
      performance_rating == 2 ~ "Good",
      performance_rating == 3 ~ "Excellent",
      performance_rating == 4 ~ "Outstanding"
    ),
    work_life_balance = case_when(
      work_life_balance == 1 ~ "Bad",
      work_life_balance == 2 ~ "Good",
      work_life_balance == 3 ~ "Better",
      work_life_balance == 4 ~ "Best"
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(age, attrition, daily_rate, department,
         distance_from_home, education,
         gender, job_role,environment_satisfaction,
         job_satisfaction, marital_status,
         monthly_income, num_companies_worked, percent_salary_hike,
         performance_rating, total_working_years,
         work_life_balance, years_at_company,
         years_since_last_promotion)

```

> Let's try to answer some questions about the data 

```{r}
skim(hr_cleaned)
```



1. How often do people leave the company (`attrition`)

```{r attrition}

mean(hr_cleaned$attrition == "Yes")*100

```
We observe that people leave the company 16.1% of the time. 

2. How are `age`, `years_at_company`, `monthly_income` and `years_since_last_promotion` distributed? can you roughly guess which of these variables is closer to Normal just by looking at summary statistics?

```{r summary}

hr_cleaned %>% 
  select(c(1,18,12,19)) %>% 
  summary()

```

Age, as usually in a normal distribution, the mean and median are identical.


3. How are `job_satisfaction` and `work_life_balance` distributed? Don't just report counts, but express categories as % of total


```{r satisfaction_distr}

satisfaction_distr <- hr_cleaned %>%
  group_by(job_satisfaction) %>%
  summarise(count = n(), percentage = (n()/dim(hr_cleaned)[1])*100) %>% 
  arrange(desc(count))

kbl(satisfaction_distr,col.names=c("Job Satisfaction Rank", "Amount", "Percentage")) %>%
kable_styling()

worklife_balance_distr <- hr_cleaned %>%
  group_by(work_life_balance) %>%
  summarise(count = n(), percentage = (n()/dim(hr_cleaned)[1])*100) %>% 
  arrange(desc(count))

kbl(worklife_balance_distr,col.names=c("Work Life Balance Rank", "Amount", "Percentage")) %>%
kable_styling()

```

The tables demonstrate that of the majority of workers (31%) have "Very High" job satisfaction rank, and "Better" (61%) work-life balance. 

4. Is there any relationship between monthly income and education? Monthly income and gender?

```{r ggpot_hr}

ggplot(hr_cleaned, 
       aes(x = ordered(factor(education), 
                                   levels = c('Below College',
                                              'College',
                                              'Bachelor',
                                              'Master',
                                              'Doctor')), 
           y = monthly_income)) + 
  geom_boxplot(alpha=0.2) + 
  labs(x = "Education Levels", 
       y = "Monthly Income (in USD$)", 
       title = "Income (monthly) by Education Level")

```
There seems to be a general tendency that people on average with a higher level of education earn a higher monthly income.

5. Plot a boxplot of income vs job role. Make sure the highest-paid job roles appear first

```{r ggpot_hrcleaned}

ggplot(hr_cleaned, 
       aes(x = reorder(job_role, desc(monthly_income), median), 
           y = monthly_income)) + geom_boxplot(alpha=0.2) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, size = 8)) +
labs(x = "Job Role", 
     y = "Monthly Income (in USD$)", 
     title = "Income (monthly) grouped by Job Role")

```


6. Calculate and plot a bar chart of the mean (or median?) income by education level.

```{r mean_income}

mean_income_by_ed <- hr_cleaned %>% 
  group_by(education) %>% 
  summarise(mean_income=mean(monthly_income))

ggplot(mean_income_by_ed, 
       aes(x = ordered(factor(education), 
                       levels = c('Below College',
                                  'College',
                                  'Bachelor',
                                  'Master',
                                  'Doctor')), 
           y = mean_income)) + 
  geom_col() + 
  labs(x="Education Level", 
       y="Mean Income (monthly) (in USD$)", 
       title="Mean Monthly Income grouped by Education Level")


median_income_by_ed <- hr_cleaned %>% 
  group_by(education) %>% 
  summarise(median_income=median(monthly_income))


ggplot(median_income_by_ed, 
       aes(x = ordered(factor(education), 
                       levels = c('Below College',
                                  'College',
                                  'Bachelor',
                                  'Master',
                                  'Doctor')), 
           y = median_income)) + 
  geom_col() + 
  labs(x="Education Level", 
       y="Median Income (monthly) (in USD$)", 
       title="Median Monthly Income grouped by Education Level")


```

7. Plot the distribution of income by education level. Use a facet_wrap and a theme from `ggthemes`


```{r monthly_income}

ggplot(hr_cleaned, aes(x = monthly_income)) + 
  geom_density() + 
  facet_wrap(~education) +
  labs(x = "Monthly Income (in USD$)", 
       y = "Density", 
       title="Distribution of Income (monthly) by Education Level")

```

8. Plot income vs age, faceted by `job_role`

```{r income_vs_age}

ggplot(hr_cleaned, 
       aes(x=age, y=monthly_income)) + 
  geom_point(alpha=0.2) + 
  geom_smooth(lwd=0.3)+
  labs(x="Age",y="Monthly Income (in USD$)", 
       title="In which role does age matter the most for monthly income?",
       subtitle="Correlation Betwen Age and Income (monthly) by Job Role") + 
  facet_wrap(~job_role)

```
