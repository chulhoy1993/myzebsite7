> Let's measure the returns of stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange

```{r load_nyse_data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
nyse <- read_csv(here::here("data","nyse.csv"))
```

Based on this dataset, create a table and a bar plot that shows the number of companies per sector, in descending order

```{r companies_per_sector}

comps_by_sector <- nyse %>% 
  group_by(sector) %>% 
  count(sort = TRUE) 

table_companies_by_sector <- comps_by_sector %>%
  kable(caption = "Number of Companies by Sector") %>%
  kable_classic("striped", full_width = FALSE) %>%
  column_spec(2, width = "7em")
table_companies_by_sector

ggplot(comps_by_sector, aes(x = reorder(sector, -n), y = n))+
  geom_col()+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90))+
  labs(title = "Number of Companies by Sector",
       x = "Sector", 
       y = "Number of companies")

```
Next, let's choose some stocks and their ticker symbols and download some data. You **MUST** choose 6 different stocks from the ones listed below; You should, however, add `SPY` which is the SP500 ETF (Exchange Traded Fund).


```{r get_price_data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}

myStocks <- c("MMM","ABB","ABT","ABBV","ACN","AAP","SPY" ) %>%
  tq_get(get  = "stock.prices",
         from = "2011-01-01",
         to   = "2020-08-31") %>%
  group_by(symbol) 

glimpse(myStocks) 
```

Financial performance analysis depend on returns; If I buy a stock today for 100 and I sell it tomorrow for 101.75, my one-day return, assuming no transaction costs, is 1.75%. So given the adjusted closing prices, our first step is to calculate daily and monthly returns.

```{r calculate_returns, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
#calculate daily returns
myStocks_returns_daily <- myStocks %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "daily", 
               type       = "log",
               col_rename = "daily_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col))  

#calculate monthly  returns
myStocks_returns_monthly <- myStocks %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "monthly", 
               type       = "arithmetic",
               col_rename = "monthly_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col)) 

#calculate yearly returns
myStocks_returns_annual <- myStocks %>%
  group_by(symbol) %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "yearly", 
               type       = "arithmetic",
               col_rename = "yearly_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col))
```

Create a table where you summarise monthly returns for each of the stocks and `SPY`; min, max, median, mean, SD.

```{r summarise_monthly_returns}

summary_monthly_returns <- myStocks_returns_monthly %>% 
  
  group_by(symbol) %>% 
  
  summarise(min=min(monthly_returns)*100, max=max(monthly_returns)*100,median=median(monthly_returns)*100,mean=mean(monthly_returns)*100,SD=sd(monthly_returns)*100) %>% 
  
  arrange(desc(mean))

kbl(summary_monthly_returns,col.names=c("Ticker","Min. Monthly Returns (%)","Max. Monthly Returns (%)","Median Monthly Returns (%)","Mean Monthly Returns (%)","Standard Deviation Monthly Returns (%)")) %>%
kable_styling()

```

Plot a density plot, using `geom_density()`, for each of the stocks
```{r density_monthly_returns}

ggplot(myStocks_returns_monthly, aes(x=monthly_returns)) + 
  geom_density() + 
  facet_wrap(~symbol) + 
  labs(x="Returns (monthly)", y="Density", title="Density Plot of Returns (monthly)")

```

What can you infer from this plot? Which stock is the riskiest? The least risky? 

From our point of view, the stock "ABT" seems to have the least variance, ie least riskiest, while ABBV has the most. However, not a stock but obviously SPY seems to be least riskiest.

Finally, make a plot that shows the expected monthly return (mean) of a stock on the Y axis and the risk (standard deviation) in the X-axis. Please use `ggrepel::geom_text_repel()` to label each stock

```{r risk_return_plot}

ggplot(summary_monthly_returns, aes(x=SD, y=mean, label=symbol)) + 
  geom_point(alpha=5) + 
  geom_text_repel() + 
  labs(x="SD", y="Mean", title="Correlation Between Mean and Standard Deviation of  Returns (monthly)") 

```

What can you infer from this plot? Are there any stocks which, while being riskier, do not have a higher expected return?

> In general, this graph seems to representate the efficient frontier illustration. Assuming similar risk level (SD), any stock is more efficient with higher return. Alternatively, assuming similar return level, any stock with lower risk (SD) is more efficient. E.g. ABB is efficient over MMM.

#IBM HR
## On your own: IBM HR Analytics

For this task, you will analyse a data set on Human Resoruce Analytics. The [IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance data set](https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset) is a fictional data set created by IBM data scientists.  Among other things, the data set includes employees' income, their distance from work, their position in the company, their level of education, etc. A full description can be found on the website.

First let us load the data

```{r hr_dataset}

hr_dataset <- read_csv(here::here("data", "datasets_1067_1925_WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv"))
glimpse(hr_dataset)

```

I am going to clean the data set, as variable names are in capital letters, some variables are not really necessary, and some variables, e.g., `education` are given as a number rather than a more useful description


```{r hr_cleaned}

hr_cleaned <- hr_dataset %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    education = case_when(
      education == 1 ~ "Below College",
      education == 2 ~ "College",
      education == 3 ~ "Bachelor",
      education == 4 ~ "Master",
      education == 5 ~ "Doctor"
    ),
    environment_satisfaction = case_when(
      environment_satisfaction == 1 ~ "Low",
      environment_satisfaction == 2 ~ "Medium",
      environment_satisfaction == 3 ~ "High",
      environment_satisfaction == 4 ~ "Very High"
    ),
    job_satisfaction = case_when(
      job_satisfaction == 1 ~ "Low",
      job_satisfaction == 2 ~ "Medium",
      job_satisfaction == 3 ~ "High",
      job_satisfaction == 4 ~ "Very High"
    ),
    performance_rating = case_when(
      performance_rating == 1 ~ "Low",
      performance_rating == 2 ~ "Good",
      performance_rating == 3 ~ "Excellent",
      performance_rating == 4 ~ "Outstanding"
    ),
    work_life_balance = case_when(
      work_life_balance == 1 ~ "Bad",
      work_life_balance == 2 ~ "Good",
      work_life_balance == 3 ~ "Better",
      work_life_balance == 4 ~ "Best"
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(age, attrition, daily_rate, department,
         distance_from_home, education,
         gender, job_role,environment_satisfaction,
         job_satisfaction, marital_status,
         monthly_income, num_companies_worked, percent_salary_hike,
         performance_rating, total_working_years,
         work_life_balance, years_at_company,
         years_since_last_promotion)

```

Produce a one-page summary describing this dataset. Here is a non-exhaustive list of questions:

skim(hr_cleaned)

1. How often do people leave the company (`attrition`)

```{r attrition}

mean(hr_cleaned$attrition == "Yes")*100

```
We observe that people leave the company 16.1% of the time. 

2. How are `age`, `years_at_company`, `monthly_income` and `years_since_last_promotion` distributed? can you roughly guess which of these variables is closer to Normal just by looking at summary statistics?

```{r summary}

hr_cleaned %>% 
  select(c(1,18,12,19)) %>% 
  summary()

```

Age, as usually in a normal distribution, the mean and median are identical.


3. How are `job_satisfaction` and `work_life_balance` distributed? Don't just report counts, but express categories as % of total


```{r satisfaction_distr}

satisfaction_distr <- hr_cleaned %>%
  group_by(job_satisfaction) %>%
  summarise(count = n(), percentage = (n()/dim(hr_cleaned)[1])*100) %>% 
  arrange(desc(count))

kbl(satisfaction_distr,col.names=c("Job Satisfaction Rank", "Amount", "Percentage")) %>%
kable_styling()

worklife_balance_distr <- hr_cleaned %>%
  group_by(work_life_balance) %>%
  summarise(count = n(), percentage = (n()/dim(hr_cleaned)[1])*100) %>% 
  arrange(desc(count))

kbl(worklife_balance_distr,col.names=c("Work Life Balance Rank", "Amount", "Percentage")) %>%
kable_styling()

```

The tables demonstrate that of the majority of workers (31%) have "Very High" job satisfaction rank, and "Better" (61%) work-life balance. 

4. Is there any relationship between monthly income and education? Monthly income and gender?

```{r ggpot_hr}

ggplot(hr_cleaned, 
       aes(x = ordered(factor(education), 
                                   levels = c('Below College',
                                              'College',
                                              'Bachelor',
                                              'Master',
                                              'Doctor')), 
           y = monthly_income)) + 
  geom_boxplot(alpha=0.2) + 
  labs(x = "Education Levels", 
       y = "Monthly Income (in USD$)", 
       title = "Income (monthly) by Education Level")

```
There seems to be a general tendency that people on average with a higher level of education earn a higher monthly income.

5. Plot a boxplot of income vs job role. Make sure the highest-paid job roles appear first

```{r ggpot_hrcleaned}

ggplot(hr_cleaned, 
       aes(x = reorder(job_role, desc(monthly_income), median), 
           y = monthly_income)) + geom_boxplot(alpha=0.2) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, size = 8)) +
labs(x = "Job Role", 
     y = "Monthly Income (in USD$)", 
     title = "Income (monthly) grouped by Job Role")

```


6. Calculate and plot a bar chart of the mean (or median?) income by education level.

```{r mean_income}

mean_income_by_ed <- hr_cleaned %>% 
  group_by(education) %>% 
  summarise(mean_income=mean(monthly_income))

ggplot(mean_income_by_ed, 
       aes(x = ordered(factor(education), 
                       levels = c('Below College',
                                  'College',
                                  'Bachelor',
                                  'Master',
                                  'Doctor')), 
           y = mean_income)) + 
  geom_col() + 
  labs(x="Education Level", 
       y="Mean Income (monthly) (in USD$)", 
       title="Mean Monthly Income grouped by Education Level")


median_income_by_ed <- hr_cleaned %>% 
  group_by(education) %>% 
  summarise(median_income=median(monthly_income))


ggplot(median_income_by_ed, 
       aes(x = ordered(factor(education), 
                       levels = c('Below College',
                                  'College',
                                  'Bachelor',
                                  'Master',
                                  'Doctor')), 
           y = median_income)) + 
  geom_col() + 
  labs(x="Education Level", 
       y="Median Income (monthly) (in USD$)", 
       title="Median Monthly Income grouped by Education Level")


```

7. Plot the distribution of income by education level. Use a facet_wrap and a theme from `ggthemes`


```{r monthly_income}

ggplot(hr_cleaned, aes(x = monthly_income)) + 
  geom_density() + 
  facet_wrap(~education) +
  labs(x = "Monthly Income (in USD$)", 
       y = "Density", 
       title="Distribution of Income (monthly) by Education Level")

```

8. Plot income vs age, faceted by `job_role`

```{r income_vs_age}

ggplot(hr_cleaned, 
       aes(x=age, y=monthly_income)) + 
  geom_point(alpha=0.2) + 
  geom_smooth(lwd=0.3)+
  labs(x="Age",y="Monthly Income (in USD$)", 
       title="In which role does age matter the most for monthly income?",
       subtitle="Correlation Betwen Age and Income (monthly) by Job Role") + 
  facet_wrap(~job_role)

```

# Challenge 1
## Challenge 1: Replicating a chart

The purpose of this exercise is to make a publication-ready plot using your `dplyr` and `ggplot2` skills. Open the journal article "Riddell_Annals_Hom-Sui-Disparities.pdf". Read the abstract and have a look at Figure 3. The data you need is "CDC_Males.csv".

```{r challenge1, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "figure3.jpeg"), error = FALSE)
```


Don't worry about replicating it exactly, try and see how far you can get. You're encouraged to work together if you want to and exchange tips/tricks you figured out.

                            fill = gun_ownership,
                            size = white_population),

        axis.ticks.y = element_line(color = "black"),
        )

```

# Challenge 2
## Challenge 2: 2016 California Contributors plots

As discussed in class, I would like you to reproduce the plot that shows the top ten cities in highest amounts raised in political contributions in California during the 2016 US Presidential election.

```{r challenge2, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "challenge2.png"), error = FALSE)
```


To get this plot, you must join two dataframes; the one you have with all contributions, and data that can translate zipcodes to cities.
You can find a file with all US zipcodes, e.g., here http://www.uszipcodelist.com/download.html. 

The easiest way would be to create two plots and then place one next to each other. For this, you will need the `patchwork` package.
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/patchwork/index.html

While this is ok, what if one asked you to create the same plot for the top 10 candidates and not just the top two? The most challenging part is how to reorder within categories, and for this you will find Julia Silge's post on [REORDERING AND FACETTING FOR GGPLOT2](https://juliasilge.com/blog/reorder-within/) useful.
