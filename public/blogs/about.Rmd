# Brief Intro: **Simon Yang**

## _Annyeonghaseyo!_ My name is Simon Yang and I'm from [South Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea). I really enjoying traveling and scuba diving and espcially enjoy scuba diving while traveling! Apart from Korea, I have lived in the following places: 

- United Arab Emirates 
- Jordan 
- Singapore 
- Hong Kong 

## As someone looking into investment banking, I would like to work in Canary Wharf in one of the many financial institutions located there. I truly feel that London is a city like no other. It is vibrant, diverse and most importantly home to all residents regardless of race, religion and education background. I am really looking forward to spending my time in London!
