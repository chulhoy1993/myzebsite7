Plotting the top 25 beer consuming countries

```{r beer_plot}

beer <- drinks %>% 
  select(country, beer_servings) %>% 
  arrange(desc(beer_servings))

top25_beer <- beer %>% 
  head(25)

ggplot(top25_beer, aes(x= beer_servings,
       y = reorder(country, beer_servings))) +
  geom_bar(stat='identity')+ labs(x="Beer Servings Consumed Per Person",y = "Country", title = "Top 25 Beer Consuming Countries")

```

Plotting the top 25 wine consuming countries

```{r wine_plot}

wine <- drinks %>% 
  select(country, wine_servings) %>% 
  arrange(desc(wine_servings))

top25_wine <- wine %>% 
  head(25)

ggplot(top25_wine, aes(x= wine_servings,
       y = reorder(country, wine_servings))) +
  geom_bar(stat='identity')+ labs(x="Wine Servings Consumed Per Person",y = "Country", title = "Top 25 Wine Consuming Countries")

```

Finally, plotting the top 25 spirit consuming countries
```{r spirit_plot}
# YOUR CODE GOES HERE

spirit <- drinks %>% 
  select(country, spirit_servings) %>% 
  arrange(desc(spirit_servings))

top25_spirit <- spirit %>% 
  head(25)

ggplot(top25_spirit, aes(x= spirit_servings,
       y = reorder(country, spirit_servings))) +
  geom_bar(stat='identity')+ labs(x="Spirits Servings Consumed Per Person",y = "Country", title = "Top 25 Spirits Consuming Countries")

```


> For beer and wine, the biggest consumer countries match the producing countries. However, for spirits the biggest consumer countries tend to be countries that tend to be more visited by consumers (except Russia and Belarus). It seems stereotypes about Russians and Eastern Europeans are not so different from reality after all!
